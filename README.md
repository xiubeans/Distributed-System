Distributed-System
==================
This is a series of labs of the course Distributed Systems. It includes implementations of: 

    1) basic communication between any pair of nodes with pre-defined configuration;
    
    2) Logical Clock and Vector Clock for causal ordering among nodes;
    
    3) Multicast service within group, using Maekawa's algorithm;
    
    4) Mutual Exclusion capability. The mutex in the distributed system.
